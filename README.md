# Hi, I'm Muhammad Ahmad 👋  

Independent Market Researcher — specializing in **Macro Policy, Market Microstructure, and Cross-Asset Analysis**.  

I study how macroeconomic factors, policy shifts, and market structure shape global asset prices (equities, bonds, FX, commodities, crypto).  

###  My Research Process
- I collect raw insights from economic data, market price action, and news flow.  
- I refine wording, structure, and presentation with digital tools (for clarity & readability).  
- Final reports combine **independent analysis + transparent refinement**.  

###  What You’ll Find Here
- **Daily Reports** → Market moves & macro drivers (short-term focus).  
- **Weekly Reports** → Bigger-picture narratives across assets.  
- **Special Notes** → Deep dives into concepts (macro cycles, microstructure, cross-asset flows).  

### 🌍 Goal
To build a transparent research archive, showing both raw market thinking and polished reports — useful for learning, reference, and professional growth.
